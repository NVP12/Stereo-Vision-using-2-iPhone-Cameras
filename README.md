## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **stereo vision system** using two iPhone 15 cameras to estimate depth from images. By calibrating the cameras and rectifying the image pairs, we generate disparity maps and estimate real-world depth. It’s designed as a low-cost DIY alternative to commercial stereo rigs, useful for robotics, AR, and computer vision education.

> 📷 Built during my MS in Robotics @ UMN and jointly developed with a teammate.  
> ⚙️ Tools used: OpenCV, Python, NumPy, and MATLAB (for calibration validation).
